# ruby-practice

This is a repository to practice what I've learnt from CodeCademy. I find that if I don't apply what I've learnt, I forget the lesson even if I've only done it a few hours earlier.

These programs are very simple but I think it's important to build solid foundations so I created this repos to practice ruby & also to practice using remote repos on Github.
